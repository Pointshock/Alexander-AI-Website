# Alexander-AI-Website ver 1.0.0

Created by Chris Tomaskovic

*****
This is the Alexander AI website that shows the predicted stock prices for Tesla
*****

The assets folder contains the logos that I used for the app.

The index.html file contains all of the HTML for the website and sets up the layout.

The style.css file contains all of the CSS to make the webstie look pretty :).

The main.js file contains all of the JavaScript to make the website run as it should. The JavaScript handles all of the code for the graph which will update when new values are added to the API.
